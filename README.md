# FSD Research Project
## Introduction
This is a research project aimed at exploring Artificial Intelligence within the field of Full Self Driving (FSD). My goal is to develop a fully functional self driving car and make a contribution to the advancement of these rapidly evolving fields.

I believe that the development of autonomous vehicles has the potential to revolutionize transportation, reduce traffic accidents and fatalities, and improve access to mobility for individuals with disabilities or limited access to transportation. Therefore, I am dedicated to conducting cutting-edge research to design and develop an FSD system that is safe, reliable, and efficient.

This project is a crucial component of my ongoing efforts to push the boundaries of AI and ML, and bring about a future of autonomous vehicles. By successfully developing an FSD system, I hope to pave the way for the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles and contribute to the advancement of transportation technology.
